# Cryptocurrencies

## *Purpose*
Martha's employer, Accountability Accounting, is considering offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. Martha and I therefore used an unsupervised learning model to process and cluster data as well as reduce the dimensions and principal components. 

## *Description*
Martha and I have created a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they are most logically grouped by classification. We used a clustering algorithm to group the currencies and data visualization to display the final results. You can see one coin is ultimately an outlier. Outside of that, there is one smaller cluster and then two other clusters that pretty evenly distribute the rest of the offered cryptocurrencies.
