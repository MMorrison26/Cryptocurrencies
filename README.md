# Cryptocurrencies

## *Purpose*
Martha and I are using unsupervised learning to process and cluster data as well as reduce the dimensions and principal components. Martha's employer, Accountability Accounting, is considering offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. 

## *Description*
Martha and I have created a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they are most logically grouped by classification. We used a clustering algorithm to group the currencies and data visualization to display the final results.
